    <h1>Travel Website Group Project 🌍</h1>
    <p>
        This project is a comprehensive travel website built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Our team developed this website as part of a group project for our university's first-year web development module. The purpose of the project was to apply the knowledge and skills we gained during the course to create a functional and visually appealing website. Through this project, we aimed to showcase our ability to work collaboratively, design user-friendly interfaces, and implement responsive layouts and interactive features using fundamental web technologies.
